# Ludum Dare 51!

## Description
A short project for Ludum Dare 51. We plan on submitting in the "Extra" category.
This was developed with relatively few hours put in.

## TODO

 **Stuff that would be nice for release:**
 - Add "Press F to enter rocket" prompt
 - Rocket particle effects
 - Make the particles on the planet look more noticeable.
 - Victory screen for beating all 5 planets
 - Hard mode (larger planet radius, only 10 particles, <10 seconds).
 - Rotate player to face the direction they're walking in.
